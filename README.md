=====================================
UniLang Language Community - Forum
=====================================

This repository contains the source code for the UniLang forum
(http://forum.unilang.org), powered by phpBB 3.1. The phpBB 3.1 source and all
custom extensions are included here.

The UniLang style resides in ``phpBB3/style/unilang/`` and inherits from the
default prosilver style.

Extensions reside in ``phpBB3/ext``. Custom-made UniLang extensions are in
``phpBB3/ext/unilang``. If you want to write a new extension or edit an
existing one, please familiarize yourself with the phpBB3.1 extension framework:

 * [Writing Extensions](https://www.phpbb.com/extensions/writing/)

Modifying the phpBB3 sources should be avoided whenever possible, preferably
add proper extensions instead or adapt the templates in the UniLang style (but
keep this to a minimum too).
