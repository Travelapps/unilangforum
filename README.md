=====================================
UniLang Language Community - Forum
=====================================

This repository contains the source code for the UniLang forum
(http://forum.unilang.org), powered by phpBB 3.1. The phpBB 3.1 source and all
custom extensions are included here.

The UniLang style resides in ``phpBB3/style/unilang/`` and inherits from the
default prosilver style.

Extensions reside in ``phpBB3/ext``. Custom-made UniLang extensions are in
``phpBB3/ext/unilang``. If you want to write a new extension or edit an
existing one, please familiarize yourself with the phpBB3.1 extension framework:

 * [Writing Extensions](https://www.phpbb.com/extensions/writing/)

Modifying the phpBB3 sources should be strictly avoided unless there is
absolutely no other way. Always either write proper extensions (strongly
preferred), or otherwise adapt the templates in the UniLang style ( keep this
to a minimum too).
